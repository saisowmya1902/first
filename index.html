<h1>BIOGRAPHY OF MOTHER TERSA</h1>
<h2>Born :26 August 1910
Skopje, Ottoman Empire</h2>
<h3>Die:5 September 1997 (aged 87)
Calcutta, India</h3>
<p>Mother Teresa (26 August 1910 â€“ 5 September 1997), was an Albanian Roman Catholic nun who started the Missionaries of Charity and won the<u><i> Nobel Peace Prize in 1979</i> </u>for her work with people.[2] For over forty years, she took care of needs of those without money, those who were sick, those without parents, and those dying in Calcutta (Kolkata), guided in part by the ideals of Saint Francis of Assisi. She was born in Skopje, Macedonia, and died in Calcutta.


As the Missionaries of Charity grew under Mother's leadership, they expanded their ministry to other countries. By the 1970s she had become internationally well known as an advocate for the poor and helpless, due in part to a movie and book, Something Beautiful for God by Malcolm Muggeridge. She did not think women had the right to have abortions and said "The greatest destroyer of peace is abortion because if a mother can kill her child, what is left for me to kill you and you to kill me?".[3]

Following her death she was beatified (the first stage of sainthood) by Pope John Paul II and given the title Blessed Teresa of Calcutta.[4][5] Mother Teresa was named a Saint on 4 September 2016 by his Holiness Pope at Saint Peter, Vatican. <u><b>Mother Teresa recieved many awards like the Bharat Ratna in 1980</b></u> and Nobel prize in 1979 etc. She is known for serving humanity.</p>
